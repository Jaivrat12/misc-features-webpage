# MISCELLANEOUS FEATURES OF A WEBPAGE

This is the final major version of my project, the previous two (alpha and beta) can be viewed by changing to the respective branch.

  - [Alpha Version](https://github.com/Jaivrat12/misc-features-webpage/tree/alpha-version) was the very first one & almost everything was implemented in this one, but the only exception being that it wasn't Moblie Responsive. You can see this alpha version [HERE!](https://jaivrat12.github.io/misc-features-alpha/).
  - [Beta Version](https://github.com/Jaivrat12/misc-features-webpage/tree/beta-version) then added some very minor features/components and looks a bit different than alpha one visually and has a drastic change compared to the alpha version in terms of HTML and CSS as Bootstrap was used to make it mobile responsive, Scripts were mixed together into a single file.
  - The Final Version (this one, main branch) is same as beta version visually, but the scripts are now more modular than ever! You can see this webpage version [HERE!](https://jaivrat12.github.io/misc-features-webpage/)


Here's the list of most of the things/info about this webpage!

Preloader
  - Cover the screen until everything in the page is loaded
  - Has a Loading Animation!

Banner
  - BG color changes constantly
  - Banner Title, etc. animate on appearance

Navbar
  - Fixed Position Navbar
  - Transparent when on page's top position
  - Scroll Progress Bar
  - Shows which section of page you're viewing currently
  - Small screen/Mobile sizes are supported
  - And ofcourse you can navigate :p

Tooltips
  - Tried to make different tooltips
  - Animates when it's scrolled into view

Popups
  - Made using Bootstrap, can be closed by either:
    - Clicking somewhere else
    - Clicking on Close Button
  - Animates when it's scrolled into view

Image Slider
  - Made to be full-screen, could not be good for small screen sizes
  - Scrolls itself perfectly into view when you click on it
  - Navbar hides itself when the image slider is in full view
  - Animated Captions for each image
  - Can be controlled with 'arrows' or 'circles'

APIs
  - Make an API request based on the search term
  - Below are the implementations of such requests
  - But these (except image one) require an API key for authentication, so there's an additional feature 'Get Random Song/Video' if you don't want to provide key.

Image Generator
  - Load a new image on click
  - There's a loading animation until it loads

Spotify API & 'iframe'
  - (Only in Alpha version:) An animation (not mine) is shown when user scrolls it into view
  - Search a song, and an animation (yeah this one's mine :p) is shown until it loads

Youtube API & 'iframe'
  - Search for a video, and again, a loading animation is shown until it's complete.

Thank you for reading this mess!
