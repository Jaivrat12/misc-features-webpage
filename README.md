A Preloader [copied google's UI :p]

Banner
  - BG color changes constantly
  - Everything on it animates on appearance

Navbar
  - Fixed Navbar
  - Transparent when on page's top position
  - Scroll Progress Bar
  - Shows which section of page you're on.
  - And ofcourse you can navigate :p

Tooltips
  - Tried to make different tooltips
  - 'Mouse-following' one not working rn :(

Popups
  - Can be closed by either
    i)  Clicking somewhere else
    ii) Clicking on Close Button

Image Slider
  - Made to be full-screen
  - Scrolls itself perfectly into view when
    you click on it.
  - Navbar hides when it's in full view
  - Can control with 'arrows' or 'circles'

APIs

Image Generator
  - Load an new image on click
  - There's a loading animation until it loads

Spotify API & 'iframe'
  - An animation (not mine) is shown when user
    scrolls it into view.
  - Search a song, and an animation (yeah this 
    one's mine :p) is shown until it loads

Youtube API & 'iframe'
