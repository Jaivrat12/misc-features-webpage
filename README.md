This is the final major version of my project, the previous two (alpha and beta) can be viewed by changing to the respective branch.

  - Alpha Version was the very first one & almost everything was implemented in this one, but the only exception being that it wasn't Moblie Responsive.
  - Beta Version then added some very minor features/components and looks a bit different than alpha one visually and has a drastic change compared to the alpha version in terms of HTML and CSS, Scripts were mixed together.
  - The Final Version (main branch) is same as beta version visually, but the scripts are now more modular than ever!


Here's the list of most of the things this page has to show! (Still needs to be edited)

A Preloader [copied google's UI :p]

Banner
  - BG color changes constantly
  - Everything on it animates on appearance

Navbar
  - Fixed Navbar
  - Transparent when on page's top position
  - Scroll Progress Bar
  - Shows which section of page you're on.
  - And ofcourse you can navigate :p

Tooltips
  - Tried to make different tooltips
  - 'Mouse-following' one not working rn :(

Popups
  - Can be closed by either
    i)  Clicking somewhere else
    ii) Clicking on Close Button

Image Slider
  - Made to be full-screen
  - Scrolls itself perfectly into view when
    you click on it.
  - Navbar hides when it's in full view
  - Can control with 'arrows' or 'circles'

APIs

Image Generator
  - Load an new image on click
  - There's a loading animation until it loads

Spotify API & 'iframe'
  - An animation (not mine) is shown when user
    scrolls it into view.
  - Search a song, and an animation (yeah this 
    one's mine :p) is shown until it loads

Youtube API & 'iframe'
  - Search for a video, and again, a loading
    animation is shown until it's complete.
